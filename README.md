# THE-ODIN-PROJECT

The Odin Project is an open-source community dedicated to providing the best information sources to take you from zero to a **full-stack developer**.<br>
We’ll start learning about how the web works and the basics of computer and web programming.

We will get familiar with:
- **Internet** and your own computer
- **Git** and **GitHub**
- The basics of **front-end** technologies like **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
- Step into **back-end**

The Odin Project’s **goal** is not to teach you any standalone skills and it is not a tutorial. The main idea is to teach you the *why and change the way you think*.<br>
One of the most important and difficult parts is adopting the right mindset.

It isn’t just about coding, it is about:
- **problem-solving**
- **asking the right questions**
- **doing enough research**
